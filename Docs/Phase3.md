# Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Cleaning
Objective: Ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis and modeling.

Drop Unnecessary Columns:

Dropped the 'Description' column as it's not needed for analysis.
Check for Missing Values:

Ensured there are no missing values in the dataset.
Data Type Consistency:

Ensured all columns are of type 'object'.
Data Validation:

Checked for any inconsistencies or unusual values in the data.
Data Visualization
Objective: Understand the distribution of the data and relationships between features.

Dress Count by Weather Type:

Plotted a count plot to visualize the distribution of different dresses across various weather types.
Heatmap of Clothing Fit vs. Weather Type:

Created a heatmap to show the relationship between clothing fit preferences and weather conditions.
Additional Visualizations:

Color Palette Distribution: Visualized the distribution of dress recommendations based on color palettes.
Pattern Preferences: Showed how different patterns are preferred across various dresses.
Feeling in Outfit: Illustrated how users want to feel in their outfits in relation to dress recommendations.
Summary of EDA:

The visualizations provide insights into how different features (Weather, Color Palette, Pattern, Feeling, Clothing Fit) relate to the Dress Name.
These insights are crucial for feature engineering and model training in the next phase, ensuring that the model can accurately predict clothing recommendations based on user preferences.
