2. Data Gathering
Initial Data Collection:

The client company provided CSV files with around 1000 data points.
The data consists of user responses to the finalized survey questions.
Steps for Data Gathering:

Data Import:

Load the CSV files into your data analysis environment (e.g., Python, R).
Data Inspection:

Inspect the data for completeness and consistency.
Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Remove duplicates.
Standardize data formats (e.g., consistent date formats, capitalization).
Data Storage:

Store the cleaned data in a structured format (e.g., SQL/NoSQL database).
Ensure data is properly indexed for efficient querying and retrieval.

3. Data Storage Setup
Objective: Set up a reliable and scalable data storage solution for storing survey responses and user information.

Steps for Data Storage Setup:

Database Design:

Design the schema for storing survey responses, user profiles, and recommendations.
Identify the key entities and their relationships (e.g., users, responses, recommendations).
Database Selection:

Choose a suitable database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Consider scalability, performance, and ease of integration with your app.
Database Implementation:

Implement the database schema.
Set up the database server and configure access controls.
Example Database Schema:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE survey_responses (
    response_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    weather VARCHAR(50),
    color_palette VARCHAR(50),
    patterns VARCHAR(50),
    clothing_fit VARCHAR(50),
    outfit_feel VARCHAR(50),
    spending_limit VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE recommendations (
    recommendation_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    response_id INT,
    recommended_outfit VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (response_id) REFERENCES survey_responses(response_id)
);

4. Data Annotation (Optional)
Objective: Annotate data with additional context or labels if necessary (e.g., tagging responses with fashion categories).

Steps for Data Annotation:

Define annotation guidelines and categories.
Train annotators or use automated tools for annotation.
Validate the quality of annotations through a review process.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your data collection phase is thorough and that the data is ready for the next phase of exploratory data analysis and model development.
